# proteus_hreye
PROTEUS-compliant implementation of HREye control.

Active lucemes are implemented, ocular lucmes are not implemented. To create new lucemes, check out the symbol_definitions folder and learn to write your own symbol definition files. 

### This is research code. As much as I would love to be able to develop it until it's extremely stable and easy to use, that's simply not the way that PhDs work. Please do your best to figure out what's going on inside this code, and if you have problems that you can't resolve, email Michael Fulton.
